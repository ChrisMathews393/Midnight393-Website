    <h1>About Midnight Monsters</h1>
    <h2>Who are we?</h2>
    <p>We are a group of friends who enjoy playing casual and competitive PC games. Some of us are pretty good at games, and some aren't (we know who's who). We enjoy all kinds of games, but our servers and streams are mainly focused on multiplayer FPS games (CS:GO, Insurgency, Modern Warfare, etc.). We'd also highly recommend Hollow Knight.</p>

    <h2>What can you find on our website?</h2>
    <p>If you're looking for high-quality, reliable dedicated game servers, that's mainly what we're focused on. We're still working on setting up everything, but we currently have a competitive Insurgency server, and a CS:GO server that rotates between Deathmatch, Competitive, and fun stuff like soccer and dodgeball maps from the Steam Workshop. We are hoping to set up more servers for more of our favorite games, including Stellaris and Team Fortress 2.</p>
    <p>Feel free to jump in our servers, which you will find on the <a href="./play">Play page</a>. We've also got a <a target="_blank" href="https://discord.gg/rzmVadp">Discord</a> with channels for every game we play. If you just like to watch, you can check out our <a target="_blank" href="https://www.twitch.tv/midnight393">livestreams on Twitch</a>, too. It's a great way to get a feel for the games we enjoy playing, as well as the fun and weird game modes we try out from time to time.</p>
    <p>Eventually, we will be writing some easy-to-follow guides so you can learn how to set up servers like we've done.</p>

    <h2>How do we keep our servers free to play?</h2>
    <p>Right now we're kinda just footing the bill for everything that goes into doing this. That includes the cloud computers that run the servers and the cost of hosting this website. It also takes a fair bit of time and effort to get new servers up and running and to maintain them. We hope that you enjoy what we do, and if you do, that you will consider <a target="_blank" href="https://www.patreon.com/Midnight393/posts">supporting us on Patreon</a> or thorugh our <a target="_blank" href="https://www.redbubble.com/people/Midnight393/shop">Redbubble store</a>. The more people support us, the more servers we'll be able to run. Those could include 128-tick servers, 24/7 decoy dodgeball, and all kinds of other ideas we've got in our heads. If you appreciate the work we've put into this, please consider supporting us on Patreon for as little as a dollar a month.</p>
