			<h2>Thank you for visiting Midnight Monsters. If you've been enjoying our guides, servers, and streams, then you'll love our patron-only content, including live cams and hot one-deags in your area. If you want to represent us, please check out our <a id="redbubbleLink" href="https://www.redbubble.com/people/Midnight393/shop">Redbubble</a> Store and get some merch!</h2>
			<h2>If you're not into the whole giving-an-internet-stranger-your-money thing, feel free to continue browsing our site and playing along with us, secure in the knowledge that our lovely patrons are trudging through a nigthmarish existence at their 9-to-5 just to put a little bread on your freeloading-ass table. Continue to leech off their generosity like the worthless black hole you are, spinning endlessly through the cosmos that is the internet while you suck away at the very lifeblood of our society. You know that nagging feeling that your very presence is a burden to everyone around you? That's how our patrons feel about you. In fact, that's how everyone feels about you. Anyway thanks for visiting our site!</h2>
