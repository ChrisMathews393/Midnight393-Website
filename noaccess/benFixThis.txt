BEN FIX THIS

add an About Us page

Change the URL names to include keywords (this will also be domain side). URL names: play - "play" guides "how-to-game-server" support us "support-us" about us "about-midnight-monsters"

Add screenshots and GIFs and stuff to the play page, maybe in a bootstrap slideshow




FIXED THIS

On super skinny, there is a big gap between the "play" and "guides" links

homepage: no footer, just links to other pages. OR put play/support us/guides on top and images/text underneath

fix the patreon logo image

Play page (everything)

Weird line on Index page

white space at the bottom of some pages

remove support us link from footer on support page

fix spacing on footer links

Scale text on supportUS

On play page, make "CS:GO" and "Insurgency" text scale. Narrowing the browser window causes it to overflow from the box

404 page

Integrate new logo

Add links to buy merch, including redbubble logo, especially on support page

sort the files, especially images and .psd and .xcf files

clean up the code on the 404 page in the #escape > .linkBox > .linkLinks HTML and CSS. It has been copied over from the play page and therefore uses <ul><li></li></ul>, but since the boxes on this page do not need multiple list items, thye could just be converted to <p>, which would save a few lines of HTML and some CSS as well
Also, in those oxes, maybe shift the a tags to be on the titles instead of the descriptions.

Different message on the 404 page

figure out why the Twitch frame doesn't seem to actually play any video in firefox

Change the message on the home page to integrate search keywords, and put it in h1 tags

Add headers with keyword and meta descriptions to the other pages

Chris - Setup google webmaster tools (will need access to domain provider)
